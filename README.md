I have not picked a name for this project yet so I will continue to use Flask_site until then.

Flask_site is a personal project for tracking bills between housemates.

*TODO*

-Fix database issue with creating users login.
-Update gitignore. I need to review best practice for this.
-Decide on a template for the site.
